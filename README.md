sales prediction for food items sold at various stores

We are presented with sales predictions for supermarkets based on products. Each product is unique in terms of its features. In this data you will find prediction models that can potentially aid in sales success. The predictions are inclusive to products and properties that aid in sales. The models that are being used are (1) linnear regression and (2) a decision tree. The linnear regression had a much lower R2 train and test score of 0.56. This score was significantly lower than the decision tree model which gave us a train R2 score of 0.60 and a test R2 score of 0.59. As you can see the score has increased slightly which has a probability in better predictions. Based on these predictions which products should be sold more, success rates in different types of markets and more.

We can see below that over time the sales has fluctuated. The sales to establishment ratio differs. The sales were at its peak in 1985 and dropped significantly in 1998 and went back up slightly in 2010.

Sales based on iten time also differ, it appears that starchy foods are sold the most in contrast to the rest of the food groups being sold. We can also see which food groups are the most popular such as starchy foods, seafood, snack foods and fruits & vegetables.
